# Binary Tree Traversal

## Description

<p>Binary tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a binary tree exactly once. There are three main types of binary tree traversal techniques: in-order, pre-order, and post-order.</p>

## In-order Traversal
<p>In in-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the root node, and finally the right subtree.</p>

## Pre-order Traversal
<p>In pre-order traversal, the root node is visited first, followed by the left subtree and then the right subtree.</p>

## Post-order Traversal:
<p>In post-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the right subtree, and finally the root node.</p>
